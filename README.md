StreetSafe is an Android application that is designed to allow drivers to communicate with each other about unsafe driving habits to improve road safety. Additional features allow users to vocally record information for later reporting or to upload in real-time. The application aimed to use Noonlight's API (formerly known as SafeTrek) as a way for drivers to use their voice to report accidents in real-time, as well. 

The goal of the application was to provide a platform for unaware drivers to learn about their vehicle malfunctions and poor driving technique quicker. Our team believes that self-awareness is the first step to correcting these issues, and with StreetSafe we hope to raise self-awareness for all drivers.
